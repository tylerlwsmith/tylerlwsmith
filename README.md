### Hi there, I'm Tyler ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer that specializes in web application development. I've built projects using a wide array of technologies that includes Django, Express.js, Ruby on Rails, Vue and WordPress, but my most frequently used tools are Laravel and React. For a full overview of my experience, you can check out [my resume](#my-resume) below.

I get pretty excited about code and technology, which is why I've been writing on [my dev.to blog](https://dev.to/tylerlwsmith) for about three years.

My GitHub profile is a little sparse right now, but I'm starting to open source some of my personal projects. If you want to know what kind of stuff I work on in my free time, look below:

### SacMusic.com

[SacMusic.com](https://sacmusic.com) is an open mic listing site that I designed, built, and maintained for open mics in Sacramento prior to the pandemic. It was built with Django REST Framework, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Nginx and Docker. The listings haven't been maintained since COVID started ðŸ™ƒ

### Matrix Maker app

Long before I started coding professionally, I studied music for a few years. I learned about writing music using a 12-tone Matrix in my atonal music class, which was a tedious process that required math to fill out a 12x12 grid. It's the perfect kind of problem for a computer to solve, so I built the [Matrix Maker app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deadhandmedia.matrixmaker&hl=en_US&gl=US) using React Native. The app is an ideal companion to help you write your next atonal masterpiece. I also plan to release Matrix Maker on the iOS App Store then open source it, but I need to make the time.

Another fun fact about me programming 12-tone matrices: the first application I ever completed was a 12-tone matrix builder that I wrote in QBasic when I was taking my atonal music theory class in 2009 (which was _well_ past the death of QBasicâ€“don't ask). I have the source code in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/tylerlwsmith/36a622930dfe56f71735865cce9b3e9c). Don't look at it it's trash: it was my first application that I ever built and I had no idea what I was doing.

### Catalytic Crime

Catalytic Crime was a Laravel project I built for tracking catalytic converter thefts in Bakersfield. I released it as a _super_ bare-bones MVP after about two weeks of development with the intention of making it prettier and adding a lot more features, but I couldn't get the data I needed to make the site worth visiting because of restrictive anti-scraping policies. 
I abandoned the project almost immediately after launching because of this ðŸ˜¢ You can read about all of my problems getting data in the [Data Acquisition section of the project's README](https://github.com/tylerlwsmith/catalyticcrime.com#data-acquisition).

### My resume

I built my resume using web technologies. Modern CSS is a powerful layout language that allows me to make page-wide changes much faster than I would be able to if I were using InDesign. Using web technologies also allows me to use the exact same code as a website, which you can find at [raspberrytyler.com](https://raspberrytyler.com/). The site is mobile responsive, uses semantic markup, and takes advantage of CSS's print styling capabilities.

When code is pushed to the main branch, the build process will use Puppeteer to generate an open graph image for the website, along with a PDF and PNG file of the resume. You can see the most recently generated image of the resume below, and you can take a look at the repo [here](https://github.com/tylerlwsmith/resume).
